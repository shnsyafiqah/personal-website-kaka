                <h2>SHARIFAH NURSYAFIQAH</h2>
                <p>I am a twenty one year old Sharifah Nursyafiqah from the stately city of
                    Petaling Jaya, Damansara Damai. I reflect a varied personality including
                    ambition, and the qualities of generosity and thoughtfulness. I am also a
                    well determined and vigorous individual, yet pleasently calm. I encourage
                    fighting for what you desire and believe in, and doing it through Allah
                    because nothing great comes easy and with Allah everything is possible.
                    <br><br>
                    I am most commonly known as Kaka, which has been my nickname since 2019.
                    One of my interests is listening to music via <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/nvx0uv9y9g5exybsltprloin2?si=1dd8c1c48b514124">Spotify</a> applications and playing
                    with kitties. I have eight cats at home, one of which I've had since 2014. My
                    passion for cats is so strong that I cry whenever I see a cat in Gaza or a cat
                    impacted by flooding. I aim to provide food to street cats every weekend once
                    I'm employed and established.
                    <br><br>
                    I am a full-time student, motivated by my love for learning and succeeding
                    as I strive to become an outstanding and successful woman in today's society.
                    With the definitive goal of becoming a professional Information Technology
                    Manager, I am currently completing the Diploma Of Information Management at
                    UiTM Rembau and soon will be taking a Bachelor of Information Science (Hons)
                    Information Content Management.

                <h2>Marketing Executive at TudungSiComel</h2>
                <br>
                <p>My first and most recent employment experience is with a firm that offers children's
                    and adult headscarves, specifically the <a href="https://tudungsicomel.com/">TudungSiComel</a> brand. I worked with this
                    company as a marketing executive from 28 February to 18 October 2021 and am now a
                    part-time employee in order to focus on my studies during this final semester.
                    <br><br>
                    At this company, I sell hijabs on Facebook live, manage the company's Instagram
                    platform, work as a hijab model, create banners, edit posters, edit videos, and
                    pack orders for customers, among other things.
                    <br><br>
                    My memories of working at this company are quite lovely. I had no idea such a
                    wonderful employer existed until I met the owner of this company, whom we refer to
                    as Encik Syah. The work environment was also rather pleasurable, as all of the staffwere quite pleasant and amusing. Everyone involves practical guidance.
